## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This was built with CSS animations, with the mathematical calculations handled by the JavaScript. setTimeout functions were used to control the thermometer animation. This was built and polished over a few days.

## Planned Features

* Animation will not reset to zero but alter to the new value from the previous value
* Clean and refactor code
* Add temperature unit to the outputted number
* Add option to convert temperatures the other way around

## Lessons Learned:

I learnt about CSS animations quite throughly with this one. I also learnt more about b√©zier curve functions and how this can effect the animations.
